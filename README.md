# Resend Confirmation Mail #

This add-on allows you to resend the confirmation email from the Admin CP for a user that has not confirmed their email yet. The benefits of this is to bring back members who didn't confirm their account, or the email didn't go through due to technical reasons, and you doing the hard work for them.
